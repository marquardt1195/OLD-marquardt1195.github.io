Recognize that you will never be perfect. Mark professes that he still makes mistakes even after 40-years of trading. The difference, however, is that his mistakes are very small and never hurt him too much. Do you know when you've made a mistake?

Ensure you first have the <b>knowledge</b> and then with that knowledge you develop the <b>skills and discipline</b> to execute your knowledge.

1. Holding Losses

MM commented about how MR has NEVER had an issue with cutting losses and I would say that I, too, have literally never questioned cutting a loss. He said that MR is an anomaly and must be within the 0.10% club b/c it's such a common error. MM said he had issues with this for ~5-years in the beginning.

Being consistent requires CONSTANT management of your risk to reward and if you can't cut losses you don't have a chance. Mark has witnessed people wipeout 10-15 years of growth and hardwork in the market due to one bad bear market. This has led to health problems, suicide, etc. You must learn to be a hawk at all times.

2. Overtrading

MR struggled with overtrading in the beginning. He has made progress by paying very close attention to his most-recent trades and combining this with knowing what he wants to see to know that "the wind is at our backs." Are you seeing pivots failing, squats, etc.? If so, that type of market action should have you trading less by default. I struggle with overtrading. This became evident during this last rally and my solution was practically the same - add 10-most recent trades on my "Positions" page.

The most common reason for overtrading in MM experience, is when people are buying good setups in a poor market. THEY HAVE TO BE WORKING. You have to bring trades into context. Overtrading can manifest itself in selling winners too soon. So you're taking gains at 6% and losses at 6% too. It can manifest itself in many ways. Most importantly, listen to MR. Look at your recent trades (feedback) and take market environment strongly into consideration. 

Overtrading is especially tempting for folks who are new and full-time. You sit in front of the screen all day and feel you need to do something.

3. Forcing Trades

Most common reasons why people force trades: (1) you want action/to be in the game, (2) pressure to outperform the market or other people, (3) pressured by losses and want to recoup.

Do PTA. Do PTA. Do PTA.

Looking at a less-than-ideal trade that MM highlighted: QCOM in Dec. 2021. Stopped following the bearish engulfing. Was this ideal? No. It was not strong enough to be a PP, it was a short, extended base (not PP) and MM already knows that he has a poor track record with these setups. Big cap stock that was likely on everyone's radar.

These three things compound eachother. You hold losses, which likely leads to you wanting to recoup your losses which results in overtrading and/or forcing trades. The flip side, however, is that GOOD DECISIONS in the marketplace COMPOUND each other too. Trading creates a lot of emotional pressure.

These things build on each other and you have to build them one at a time. They support each other, like legs of a table. Also, recognize that you can't necessarily perfect these things. Like selling. However, your goal should be to minimize these errors as much as possible, especially FOMO. This should be as close to eliminated as possible. Anyone ever golf an 18? Were always improving and even Mark M. admits that there's only a handful of things on the list (twitter poll) that he's perfect at, like: cutting losses, executing at buy point (and not chasing). When you consider the majority of things on that list, he's a work in progress. Always looking to learn and improve. You will be forever!

Consider learning each of these topics as little journeys. Their little journeys within a much larger journey that is your stock trading career.

Consider adding a 'tag' to your trades that identifies the type of base / pattern you're buying. Then go back and analyze how those setups perform for YOU. Either way, when doing PTA, analyze them according to setup type.

1. Sit out Power

FOMO is what makes it so difficult to sit out. Nowadays were all equipped with a machine gun and able to buy whatever and whenever. But you shouldn't be doing that. <b> It takes one or two good periods to realize the value of waiting for them. </b> 

2. FOMO

HAVE RULES. Remove all the emotional, on the spot decisions. Being as mechanical as possible is the key to eliminate FOMO. If you're susceptible to FOMO, you need to build protection mechanisms (like having rules for everything and planning everything out ahead of time). Just like an ex-alcoholic: don't go to a party where everyone is drinking, build protection mechanisms!

MR: "I used to chase gaps", for example. Seems like they gap up and just go, however, in doing that over time, he realized that it just doesn't pay on average. Then, follow the stats of those trades and see how they play out. This is partly how Mark became so picky about low-risk entry points. If I do this 1,000 times, where am I? Put in your journal that you made a FOMO trade. Track them and see if they pay.. <b> The goal is to make money. Are you a business man? Is this a hobby that's filling a need for excitement / exhilaration? </b>

3. Selling too Soon

<b> Buying right solves a lot of your problems. </b>

*Dec 2, 2021*

This recording is GOLD for dealing with whipsaw markets!
</center>

<div class="box1">
<font color="black">

If you're not doing well, either your criteria/discipline is flawed or the market is poor. That's it.

1. Batting Average

You have no control over your batting average. In trading, you will be wrong often. The trick is not figuring out how to be right all the time (or improve your batting avg), it's figuring out how to be profitable while knowing that you will be wrong often. <b>During tough periods, your batting avg may only be 20%, this is where you have to figure out how not to lose money.</b> One way to do this, finance risk ASAP (even at 1:1) and free roll the rest. It's learning how to adapt the factors that you can control (position sizing, avg loss) while knowing that your batting average will be low and you cannot control it. 

If you can figure out how not to lose during tough periods, you're going to do really well during the easy dollar periods. Either figure out how to finance risk quickly or exercise <b> sit out power.</b>



2. Whipsaw Markets

Don't worry about profitability. Just worry about breaking even and getting feedback from the market. Recall "Mind blowing math" if you can break even during the bad periods and be there for the good periods, you can make a fortune. You don't need to be making money every day, it comes in bunches. You don't need much time, you just need to NOT lose.

3. Following Rules

Have very clearly defined and established protocols. Get very mechanical. If new, keep it very basic and limit yourself to a very select set of circumstances from which you buy. As minimal # of moving parts as possible. Narrow it down to top 5 or 10% RS names. Always stay within your own emotional limits.

<font color="black">

Always ask yourself where you would be if you made 'X' decision 100 times. It's all about risk-to-reward. The stock market presents tremendous opportunity and it also presents tremendous risk. However, the beautiful thing about the stock market, unlike anything else, is you can choose to keep risk very small and sell out as soon as you want. You can be wrong a huge # of times and still make a fortune. 

On a breakout to new highs, very often (between 40-60% depending on the market), the stock will pullback to the breakout point. Be careful setting a breakeven stop too soon. A pullback to the buy point is less likely on pullback buys. Several ways to manage risk after a breakout, one way is to cut stop in half, from -5% to -2.5% for example, <b>or to wait until it clears the high of the first natural reaction.</b> 

After buying a breakout, Mark looks for: follow through on volume. The sooner the better. Then, if it pulls back, look for support on 3 lower low's ideally on light volume. 3-4 lower low's. We want high volume out and low volume in. Getting support on the 3rd lower low is a sign of institutional support and 'tennis ball action.' 

Violations to consider after the breakout: Does it close below the 20-DMA? High volume coming back into the breakout area? You should be reducing your position (even before it hits the stop) if you see violations piling up and don't stubbornly hang in there.

Marks average loss is generally 3.5-6%. Mark buys post-earnings gaps or PEG's. Looks at this like a short stroke and must have all the usual characteristics. SANM during ~Aug 2014 is an example of a solid PEG setup.

As a trader, your goal is not to get the high; it's simply to make more money than you risk and do that as many times as possible.

[![](figures/tutorials/TradingvsInvesting1.png#round){.img-thumbnail}](figures/tutorials/TradingvsInvesting1.png#round)

(1) Stock runs up 2-5%, DO NOT move stop to breakeven. That's too tight and will likely choke the trade off.

(2) Once you're up 8-12% (or around that average gain), Mark regards that as a decent sized gain. Now you want to look to protect the gain, or at the very least, you're breakeven point. Once the stock surpasses the high of the natural reaction, that is the time to move the stop up to breakeven or near breakeven.

<b>When & how to think like an 'investor':</b>

<u>When:</u>

The time to think like an 'investor' is at the beginning of a new bull market, just after a long bear. This is where you can get much longer, sustained moves. If you're on a key leader, upside could be huge and it's worth considering holding a small piece (at least) for a large move. Realize that by doing this, however, you'll have to hold through major corrections, undercuts of significant lows and several base-building phases.

When entering a PowerPlay setup or when buying from an IPO base. Powerplay is a velocity setup. IPO base is a magnitude setup. Both have potential to make huge moves.

<u>How:</u>

One way to manage the position while holding for a larger move is using the <b>breakeven or better rule</b> where you use the 50-day MA as a trailing stop. That is, once the 50-day MA is at the same level/price as your buy point, you switch over to using a close below the 50-day MA as a trailing stop. This helps you stay in there and hold for a larger move. Your breakeven stop turns into a trailing stop.

Very important to watch the stock immediately after placing the trade. <b> The best sign that you're going to make money on the trade is when you have the breakout followed by at least 2-3 additional days of buying. These get away from the breakout quickly and are "hard to buy". </b> It's all about know what to expect. REFERENCE POINTS.

<u>Bullish Signals</u>

1. 2-3 follow through buying days
2. Quiet price action subsequent to breakout
3. Reversal recovery from "squat"

<u>Bearish Signals</u>

1. Close below 20-day soon after breakout lowers odds of success
2. 3 consecutive down days with NO SUPPORTIVE ACTION on day three lowers odds of success
3. Wide price action (increased volatility) on volume lowers odds of success

We don't want the stock to be whipping around after breakout. Alpha not beta. We want it to breakout, get quiet, and pull-in on low volume and then to shortly thereafter move higher. "Tennis Ball Action" after a "Natural Reaction". It will very often (~50%) pull back and retest the breakout area. <b>Be OK with having a 4-7% gain vanish as it retests the breakout area for a few days. This is where judging the theme/health of the market will pay off. Are stocks moving higher or failing after the initial breakout? Always pay attention to the theme as many of these signals will happen together or across many names.</b>

Quiet action following the b/o is ok. During a reversal or squat, look for it to take out the high within a few days to a week or two. Beware of violations or "bearish signals". <b>Also consider -- is there a theme in the market? Noticing one or several of these things happening over and over? </b>

How many stages or bases has the stock already gone through? Many of the stocks Mark is highlighting during this period (late Nov. 2013) are somewhat suspect because it's late in the market and things are getting volatile. Keep this in mind -- longer time frames at the beginning of a new bull and shorten time frame as see warranted as market has been in uptrend for some time. Volatility major clue.

Additional Notes:

David Ryan clarification: three lower low's doesn't apply (become as concerning) if they are very minor price moves. Everything in context.

Mark does not apply these signals to the general market. Is the market distribution or accumulation dominant? That's about all he cares about and keeps it as simple as possible. FOLLOW THE STOCKS.

You'll oftentimes get a "flight to quality" as the bull gets later stage. This is where money goes into big caps and it's a defensive play (as we've seen for much of 2023). Don't worry about stocks getting downgraded by analysts. Many great names get downgraded and it shouldn't phase you - just follow price action.

Mark was mentioning how around this time the market was feeling like a grind and not easy to make money. At this same time, I noticed the % NAS stocks above 200-day was also deteriorating - failed to break higher and had shortly thereafter put in a couple lower low's.

MPA is NOT A MODEL PORTFOLIO. Mark will generally own the first few that breakout up to 10-12 names maximum. Generally between 4-6 names.

How do you know which stocks to buy?

1. Don't have favorites
2. <b> Buy in order of breakout </b>
3. Don't keep adding positions if trades are stopping you out.
4. Don't keep trading the same size if trades are stopping you out.
5. When things are working step up your exposure - build on success.
6. When things are not working scale back.
7. Use forced displacement to add names when a stock is sold.

What if you're at a decent gain (~20%) within just a few days?

Very often what Mark will do is sell half into the strong move upward. Selling half is a win-win. At that point, it is a free trade even with the stop in the same place as it was originally. You don't want to move the stop up too quickly, and you want to let the stock go through a natural reaction. Sometimes Mark will add it back as it breaks out above the high of the natural reaction, then at that point, you can raise your stop to breakeven or your initial buy point (NOT necessarily the low of the natural reaction). Now your first half is nailed down and second half is free rolled. This way you can hold through a second natural reaction unless it makes a very accelerated move. If it moves up significantly, Mark will just sell right into that.

[![](figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size2.png#round){.img-thumbnail width=49%}](figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size2.png#round)
[![](figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size3.png#round){.img-thumbnail width=49%}](figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size3.png#round)

Notice how the buys and add buys are still within the base. Mark is only adding a 2nd buy if the stock is still within the base and actually improving. Don't do this to stocks that are running up and extended from the base.

Here's an example:
[![](figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size4.png#round){.img-thumbnail}](figures/tutorials/MPA_psn_size4.png#round)

Mark lost almost nothing on this trade despite doubling his size on the 2nd 'Add' buy. He did this by raising his full stop to below the pivot of the handle. This locked in the gains from the 1st buy and he took a normal, acceptable loss on the add. <b>Through these methods, Mark effectively achieved asymmetrical leverage by increasing size to win big if it works but lose almost nothing if it doesn't.</b> ALWAYS look to increase size and build larger positions while NEVER increasing risk along with it. Do just the opposite: increase size without increased risk.

When you add to an existing trade, how much do you add on the 2nd buy (same size or smaller)?

It depends. Generally what I'll do is double up on a position if I add to it. Mark is big on going in with a smaller positions than normal until things are working. <b>Once things are working, I don't waste any time. I go right in at a full position.</b> Once I have some traction and I can see in the market that things are acting right, I go straight in with a full-position. <b>If the market isn't easy dollar, generally, I'll go in with a quarter or half position and double up each time.</b>

You don't EVER have to be fully invested to make a big return. In fact, Mark is oftentimes 50% in cash. Consider this - if in any given year you can only make 100 trades, it doesn't matter if you're 100% invested or 0% invested at times, or if you stay 25% invested at all times with 75% cash at all times, either way it doesn't matter. Your results are the same either way, regardless of total exposure. <b> Therefore, it is not necessary to have the feeling that you need to be fully invested! </b>

### Q&A SESSIONS

<div class="box">

<span style="color:#FFFF99">Q&A Session June 26, 2023</span><br>
</center>

<div class="box1">
<font color="black">

Mark: Many people think the breakout is the key. It's not. The quietting of price action around the supply area, is the key. It's telling you that supply has stopped coming to market. We don't want a stock with supply, that's what leads to volatility. We want no supply and a shit load of demand. This imabalance is what Jesse Livermore called the 'Line of least resistance." It gets defined as the supply gets weeded out of the market. Once you make this determination of a stock setting up and supply being chewed through, then you want to watch the stock after it breaks out. If it pulls back to the breakout area, you want to watch for the stock to catch support, confirming the demand for the stock. If it doesn't catch support, it's telling you that all you have is retail buying and there's no 'real' demand for the stock. This explains why after stocks breakout that have actually gone through supply/demand dynamics, move very quickly. They can either move up or down quickly, but it's because of this imbalance. A little buying can move it up quickly, but even a little selling will bring it right back down. 

After the breakout, you must assess- is this real institutional demand or just retail traders breaking it out just from the chart? That's where you look for the follow through. The tennis balls/natural reactions. If you get the setups, they're breaking out, they're following through.. Now you know there's an appetite for risk out there.

Going into each day with a clear plan is what Mark Ritchie does to stay in check and no overtrade. Have a plan each day and go into the day ready to execute on nothing but YOUR plan. If that means only looking at 1-2 stocks, that's all you look at. You have to figure out what works. Try being more stringent with your rules- only certain RS stocks, only 1 setup, etc. 

I need to be better at going into each day with a comprehensive plan and LET NOTHING come into my mind that day. Have a complete plan and have the discipline to follow it. Mark M. even said, you shouldn't be getting your ideas from 'this' service..

The way to calculate RS (if you didn't have access to RS) is take the 12-month ROC and sort the list from highest to lowest. Meaning, the stocks that have gone up the most over the last 12-months are the highest RS.

Mark M. rereads his own Mindset book while on the toilet.. lol. Very important to keep these ideas fresh. Read a section each time you use the bathroom..

You'll likely never scale in perfectly during a new bull market or scale out perfectly at the end of a bull. Just look to minimize mistakes.. Don't get hung up on being perfect.

PCVX, top winning stocks don't look like this. Skewed out to the right. Not ideal but maybe tradable.

Short base is 4-5 weeks minimum. 6-8 is what Mark likes to see, minimum. Unless, PP, then 2-3 weeks.

Always think risk vs reward.

No prejudice in the market. If you're great, you'll get rewarded. If you're not getting rewarded, you either don't have the skill or the market is bad. Mark Ritchie made more money on year 7 of his journey than he did in the prior 6. Mark M. said the same. Develop the skill and it will pay you for life.

If a stock has great fundamentals on the table, the only real difference that makes in Mark Ritchies tactics is that he might play the name for a larger move..

Historically, Mark Minervini will typically do 250-500 trades per year, minimum. Never done less than 125-150 trades in a year.

Mark Ritchie averages several hundred trades per year.

When it comes to trading negligible size positions in a tough environment - the effect on your portfolio might be meaningless, but it's not meaningless if it's giving you valuable information.

A close below the 20-day MA just after a breakout, historically not the best sign. 50-day MA even more ominous.

Q: Is FIX late stage base?
<br>
 
Don't read into base counting too much. It's mainly relevant after a long drawn out bull market. But David Ryan said, be careful with base counting b/c it can be subjective. Also, sometimes you can get climax runs when late stage so don't worry too much about late stage or not. You'll get stopped out either way. Remember what Ed Sykota said: "Go where the momentum is."
 
During good periods, Mark R. will oftentimes sell in thirds. But it depends. The main thing is thinking about going in and out incrementally. Half is great for psychological reasons.

Remember when adding, "Would I buy it here if I didn't own it already?" Also, it's no problem to add more shares than the original buy if the setup improves and you went in with a starter position.

Mark has learned over the years that, SMALL GAINS ADD UP. Happens more often, less volatility in those original moves. As trade progresses, it gets more volatile. Shorter-term helps with consistency, but it's a lot of work and requires more trading, when compared to longer term trading / investing.

NVDA was an "if you can't beat em, join em" type of trade.

<u>Goals to set in Market:</u>

(1) Not Losing Money

(2) Consistent application of discipline

Thinking about something Mark said in the Q&A session on Friday.. One of your main goals in the market should be to apply your discipline consistently. Even if your discipline is not perfect, it's important that you apply it consistently. Then, after doing that for some time, you can go through and critique / improve your discipline to achieve superperformance. This is super relevant b/c last week I was questioning my decision to sell 1:1 to finance risk, thinking, "we'll it only reduces my risk by $12 and I already have a small position." This, however, is not congruent with my goal. I need to be less concerned with having perfect rules than I am about doing something consistently. It's ok if financing risk 1:1 isn't perfect, I already know it will improve my numbers, but it's ok if not perfect. Just do it and do it consistently. Then, after a few months, look back and critique it. You should do this over and over and eventually you will have 'critiqued' everything about your strategy.

On an earnings gap up while at a multiple of risk, even in an easy dollar environment, Mark Ritchie will generally lighten up into that strength. If many names are being sold and consistently moving higher (costing you $ but great sign), then he might sell less to hold more for a bigger move. <b>NEVER HOLD A LARGE POSITION INTO EARNINGS.</b> MR holds into earings fairly regularly (with light position) when he's at a profit. If no profit, almost never holds into earnings.

Pilot buys for Mark Ritchie are generally 1/10th of his full position. In that case, 2.5% position. The goal isn't to make money, it's "to see if I can make any money, or find any footing". Like sticking a mirror around the corner in old western movies.

<u>Question:</u> If the market is selling off, do you start selling positions and/or adjusting risk based on volatile market?

<u>Answer:</u> I always default to the stocks. I never get my cue from the market, always the stocks that I'm in. Now, if I'm feeling a lot of pressure and am near my accepted portfolio dollar risk, I may start lightening up or synching up stops, but never selling just because general market is going down. STOCKS LEAD. Just like prior to 2020 COVID crash.. We were stopped out of names several weeks before the market really opened up (to the downside) that is because the stocks lead! Never let the general market lead you.

<b>Want to hold for a bigger move?</b> 

Wait to sell at a weekly close below the 10-week OR for three weekly lower low's and this will keep you in the best names that can make huge moves. The best names won't do this until the bulk of the move is over / needs time to consolidate.

<u>Example:</u> AXON back in 2003-2004, one of Mark's great trades. Notice how on weekly it never even closed before the 10-week MA during its entire move up. 

<u>Mark: A batting average in the 20's-30's is about the worst it gets.</u> Mine is just under 10%. This tells me I NEED TO BE MORE SELECTIVE. This seems right considering I made several mistakes so far this year that I've learned from and corrected: (1) realizing that MPA isn't a model portfolio and that Mark's only buy a handful. Follow the "trade blocks" template on the home page. I had in my head that Mark "buys 90% of all names on the platform" and later realized that simply isn't true. (2) FOMO.

You cannot lean on open profits unless you have a backstop to guarantee a set amount of profit. Must be essentially closed or guaranteed for you to lean on them.

Mark Ritchie's long term numbers: almost 3:1 and just under 40% batting average.

In bear markets, it's institutional selling into retail buying. Bull market is retail selling and institutional buying.

Always buy in the order of breakout.

When Mark Ritchie wants to get 20-25% invested, he will typically do that with 1-2 positions. This rally, he's "taken more of a shotgun approach" and has bought 4-5 names to get to 20-25%. The MPA platform has 17-18 positions on and this is only to show what's breaking out and how they're doing. This is supposed to be contrasted or compared with our own trading so we can get an overall feel for the performance of our strategy. Mark says that even though they have nearly 20 names on, the most he would personally have is 4 to 5 or perhaps 6-8 partials depending on conditions. MAX 8 names to start. They will NEVER actually own this many names.

When it comes to fundamentals, the code 33 is the best b/c it is how institutional investors operate. They look for earnings surprises, breakout years on earnings, 3 quarters of accelerating earnings, sales, margins; 2 quarters, etc. It's all in the chapter "Fundamentals to focus on" in Marks first book. These institutions have programs that pick out companies with these fundamentals on the table. When it comes to shorter time frame where you're looking to get 10-15% gains, fundamentals don't really matter. However, if you want the key leaders and want to hold for large moves, fundamentals become very important. 

Recall the book, "How I made 2,000,000 in the stock market" by Nicholas Darvas. He had a rule, the DOW must be in an uptrend for at least 6-months before he would even consider buying.. <b> We're not looking to get the low. We're looking to not lose money and wait for the periods where we can get very aggressive and make a lot of money. The low is meaningless! </b>

When it comes to bad closes, using CBAY as an example, MONALERT was showing nearly 2:1 violations to confirmations that were mostly the result of poor closes prior to breakout. Mark say's these 'violations' are mainly something he watches post-breakout and that they aren't too concerning to not buy because closes were tight, volume was drying up. It certainly has the look so don't get too worried about the closes prior to breakout if everything else looks good.

HUBS made a huge correction. It's just starting to turn up, has a short little base. This is why it doesn't make the cut. 

AQUA had a proposed merger (shown as PM on Marketsmith chart) and with this you need to be very careful. Could fall through. This has kept Mark away from the name and is not even considering it.

It's a career full of mistakes. You can't force the experience. 12-15% are typical swing trading gains.

In regards to a reversal day on a breakout: "If it breaks out and then reverses, we want to see it go inside and stay tight and over the next few days to a week, take out the high of the reversal day. This is called a reversal recovery and precisely what you want to see. It means supply has been cleared out." <b>YUMC on 3/17 and subsequent action is perfect example of reversal recovery.</b>

It is very important that the volume comes down in the pivot. <b>The combination of tight price action and low volume tells you that supply is no longer coming to the market.</b> It doesn't mean that supply will come into the market, but it's a good indication and gives you your best shot at an explosive situation. The odds are in your favor. There could always be sellers who come out of the woodwork who weren't there at lower prices.

Is TH a PB buy here?

It is technically a pullback buy if it takes out the high of the previous day, but because of the recent market action, it's not perfect and not the best buy. Be more of a stickler during these periods and recognize the nuance of this pullback buy that makes it less than ideal. "It is acting pretty good though."
