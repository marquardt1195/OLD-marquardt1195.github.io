<u>Chapter 1 Takeaways:</u>

(1) Beliefs are chosen. Are ALL of your beliefs serving you or crippling you?
(2) You assign meaning / emotion to things. Without it, it's just raw data waiting to be interpreted.
(3) Your circumstances are a reflection of your choices.
(4) Get out of the past. Change your perspective about past experiences / circumstances if they don't serve you. Spend your time thinking about / imagining the perfect YOU. How does that person think & behave?
(5) You have it all. right now. Live in it!

From The Dalai Lama, "If you want to know what will happen to you in the future, look at what your mind is doing right now."

We alone decide what our personal experiences mean to us. We are the creators of our feelings.
