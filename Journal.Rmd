9 down days in a row on the IWO, wow! Things feel and look worse than I had expected on this pullback. Is this just forming the left side of a scary looking shakeout?

Decent action from Focus List today. Several names put in solid days and firmed up. CRVL, NFLX, PERI, MGNI, ONON, SGH, ESE. Not entertaining anything right now. Just watching. Feels like mid-week we could see some pivot failures in these names but well see.

Underneath the surface things continued to deteriorate today. Perhaps this will be more than just a light pullback. Light volume on indexes. Most were green today but on light volume. New highs/new lows registered more new lows on the nasdaq today. Breadth readings showing declining % above ma's. Wait and see mode. Feeling the pulse of the market..

<b>
Right now the market is telling me to be cautious. I recently got stopped out of positions, TML's are getting loose and/or looking vulnerable, indexes are under distribution, New highs/new lows is deteriorating along with most breadth readings. From a contrarian perspective, sentiment is getting slightly bearish but nothing major to make me take a contrarian stance. Ideally, we'd see sentiment continue to deteriorate, while stocks hold up underneath the surface and the indexes pullback on lighter volume and get support at key areas. Watch that Russell 2000. Even more importantly that stocks are setting up and buyable. Are there lots of names on Focus list?
</b>

It's been a weird week. I think I understand what depression is and what it feels like. First time that happened was when I moved to SLC and then again while here. Much easier this time around being with Adriana. Learning that I have mental / emotional weaknesses that I need to work on. I recently, within the past two days or so, made some mental shifts or adjustments that have helped me navigate the move: be patient and treat yourself with grace. Moving is tough. Starting a business is tough. The stock market is tough. Be patient with yourself and make necessary adjustments. Everything is new and I needed to make some mental adjustments to help me cope with no current income and a home that doesn't feel like home. On to the market..

TML's look tired. Some earnings blowups: HUBS & RMBS. Most of the names recently starting to see reversals and volatility. SMCI is the standout exception. Many names look vulnerable to more downside: MNDY, GLBE, UBER, ORCL. SOFI lost entire earnings move. Will be interesting to see if we get support in these names around the 50dma, like: NVDA, UBER. Strongest looking TML's: SMCI, PLTR, NVDA, ELF, with plenty more having just blasted off and extended, like: NIO, UPST. Taking a look at the weekly's of these names, they reiterate recent volatility, however, some names like NVDA, GLBE, UPST, MRVL look fine on weekly chart. Just might need time..

QQQ, SPY, DJI all saw distribution last week. Several weeks distribution on QQQ. Look for support at 370 level, 50dma, or at 355 level. Russell 2000 growth saw distribution Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. IWM pulling in on light volume. Will be interesting to see if Russell can hold up as this could indicate relative outperformance in the near-term.. Looking for this.. Nearly every breadth reading shows momentum leaving the market over the intermediate-term: ST and LT % above ma's generally declining, new highs new lows deteriorating. Sentiment moving slightly bearish. Look to see if new low's begin to outpace new highs.. Either way, I would expect the pullback to show less new lows and for a shorter amount of time than the previous pullback from March-June. Right now I'm viewing this as a pullback within a greater uptrend. Pullbacks are buyable. Looking to enter the Russell on a pullback. Let's see if a pivot will develop. VIX also spiked up. 

Another hole in my system has to do with DeepVue. I realize I have no clue how group moves have been manifesting. It's been tough to notice group info with my DeepVue setup. I've made some changes (more needed) to my setup to help show group info. It includes showing the Industry Group Rank next to the name in the screener and viewing my screens ranked by Industry group first and RS second. So far this is helping. Noticing homebuilders, industrial services, technology services, Finance, steel, oil and gas, non energy minerals, have many names that have made big advances.

Added to MRVL today and started a position (1/4) in MNDY today. Looking at new RS10 screen past two days and plenty of stocks doing well and continuing their advances. Being super selective but taking setups as I see them. Will not play into the volatility. Keeping things tight on these recent buys until they work.

Stalking NVDA to see if it breaks out or breaks down. Staying tight and looks like it wants higher. Is this a good way to gauge the market? Will MRVL behave similarly and likely be influenced by NVDA? I think yes. Come back to this... NVDA, SNPS, MRVL, AVGO, etc. look similar. What % of a stocks move is the result of the group move?

Note: add more info in a nested table in the Open positions table so that you can see entries- price, quantity, date.

<u>JOURNAL</u>

Lots of names with earnings coming up. Risk elevated. Not seeing many names setup. Not the time to get aggressive with new buys. General market saw minor distribution last two weeks. 

Looking at some of the clearly defined leaders like: SMCI, NVDA, UBER, PLTR, GLBE, HUBS. They ALL pulled back and had bad days on 7/14 and 7/19. Just like my portfolio.. Considering what happened to my portfolio on 7/14, it would be wise to be cautious when you see the leaders begin to falter.. 7/19 as well as following days I saw my profits vanish and stops starting to get hit. Watch the leaders, if they get clobbered, watch out! On the flip side, the leaders have all recovered and look very solid to continue higher. This indicates more upside to the market. Continue to monitor and look for setups. Be very selective and cautious but it's certainly ok to entertain new buys. 

Started an 'RS 10' scan. Monitor the top 10% RS names in the market and scan daily. Only scan needed to run daily. Constant 364 names. Will be much easier to gauge the pulse of the market with a constant # of names to look at. 

<u>LEARNING LESSONS:</u>

Lots has happened since the last entry. Had written some entries in real-time in the latter half of July but lost them all due to Windows 10 malfunction. Not a big deal. Re-writing some stuff below. 

I learned some very important lessons during this past rally- looking at my results you see green. More wins than I've had in some time. I had 5 winning trades clustered together; yet, when looking at my NAV you see I made virtually no progress now with the market pulling back. This highlights some very important mistakes: I was progressively buying and increasing exposure right into the market pullback. Classic. I believe this is a clear sign that I'm still in the 'mechanical stage' where I'm simply executing when prompted without much intuition/experience to override the mechanics. One essential intuitive feel I need to develop is understanding when momentum is beginning to stall and the market / my portfolio is likely to pullback. Ideas on "how" to develop this feel below. In my experience, when the market pullback, so will your account. To take Mark's advice of 'ignoring the market' totally literally would be a mistake. Simply, ignore the indexes during the trading day and don't look at them until the market is closed. I definitely took this too literally in the past and didn't consider the market pulling back in my execution. It absolutely should be considered and if you have reason to believe the market will pullback, you have to ask yourself, "am I willing to let X stock stop me out or would I rather guarantee profits?" Because usually half will stop you out on the pullback, so it's very much a reality and should be baked into the cake. It happens ~50% of the time. FACT. What's the plan? This is also important because it should influence you to stop buying or reduce the exposure of "late" buys. If you start to see squats, reversals, pressure on portfolio, market is extended, leaders are extended, would this warrant exercising caution? Using a single RS screen will help make this so much clearer as long as it's analyzed every day. Alternatively, if you're coming off of a market correction, leaders are setting back up/ basing, stock ideas setting up and buyable, would this be THE RIGHT time to start heavy (provided that things had been working previously)? YES. These are the 'outside' factors that need to be considered!

One way to gauge this momentum and stay in-tune with MY market of stocks- use RS6 or some other RS scan as your main 'pulse' of the market. I like this because it always shows you the same # of stocks. Top 6% RS is around 200 stocks on DeepVue. Want to see more, check top 10 RS, for example. This way I can quickly get a pulse of the best stocks in the market and quickly check them each day to note the changes. Many looking extended? Breaking down? WHAT ARE THE BEST STOCKS DOING? With the 5-month uptrend as my main screen, it was too difficult as the # always changed and quickly became 600+ names. Too many and too much delta. Mark Ritchie uses this as his main screen too and I'm learning why..

Another issue that happened as a result of this 'transition' from bear to bull (or when experiencing stocks working on avg that are in my universe) is that I went from pilot positions (~$20 risk) to increasing my account size to nearly 20k and going in 10-12.5%. Risking 100 or more. I got to that size just before the market started pulling back. Two things to note about this: you can't just wake up and buy everyday and you shouldn't.. "It was never the buying that made the big money, it was the sitting." Sound familiar? The second thing is that now that I've seen a successful rally and stocks working, I will go in heav(ish) (~12.5%) right off the bat and look to scale to 25%. This needs to be done when momentum is just coming back into the market, not way later after several stocks have worked and I'm up on several names. That's the time to slow the buying. Honestly, I think this will take care of MANY problems b/c when I actually have that much exposure on I won't be looking to add names ("b/c now stocks have proven themselves and now I need to find a name to get heavy in"). I will already be heavy and it will be in the first to work (or not work). Additionally, by having this much size on, it will allow me to scale out more incrementally, and actually hold a piece for a larger move. Previously, I had so little that it felt pointless to continue to hold. This will by default force me to hold less names for longer and be in the better names heavier that breakout early in the rally.

Bought BLMN today. Up immediately. All positions green mid-day with strong action coming from mid- and small-cap stocks.

QQQ's continuing their pause while stocks on focus list are breaking out and holding up. IWM and IWM up over 1% midday, meanwhile, the QQQ's are red. Many big tech names like UBER, GOOGL, also pausing. Seems like this could be exactly as Mark described where we initially had the big-tech, more mature companies get bids off the market lows and it's not until later that institutions move out on the risk curve. Appears we could be right there. Some unknown names definitely getting bids and feels like its spreading out. If I can get traction with current list of names, I will be bringing portfolio money back.

Weird canary in the coal mine is the yields. 1-yr and 2-yr just put in new high's today. How does this factor in?

Bought CMG yesterday and SMCI, TMDX today. Stopped on AXSM today after it gapped down huge. Glad I took profits on the way up! Last two times I've decided to 'hold for bigger moves' they have come all the way back from +15% gains to stop me out. Something to consider for next time. Will likely just take profits. I'm buying more this week as stocks on focus list are working and market internals have been improving nearly all week. I can't tell if I'm jockeying for positions or overtrading at this point. Either way I accept the relatively small risk but it's tough. Buying solid setups. TMDX was perfect VCP and SMCI was bottomfishing a power pivot. I saw it working and went for it. 1 share. Time to gauge market feedback. WILL BE SURE TO SELL ON THE WAY UP.

Stopped on PCVX today. Quite a few names broke hard to the downside.

BE SUPER SELECTIVE. FINANCE RISK WHEN AVAILABLE. COME IN WITH A PLAN.

Going through my June trades, there are 3 names that account for $73 of losses that I should have never bought: MBLY, ASML, MRVL. It's not that they were terrible setups (MBLY was), but they're so-so. Why buy anything but ideal setups in a shitty market? I need to be more selective and get less excited when things are working for a couple of days. Be more patient. Things take time to play out in the market.

I need to go into each day with a COMPLETE PLAN. That plan should focus on choosing stocks with tighter risk b/c the upside has been limited on average. Be more selective than average. Look to finance risk at 1:1. Many stocks have been slowly chugging up only to give it all back within a day when the market starts pulling in. As the stock moves up, look to sell some into strength to finance the risk. If you happen to get on one that is moving quickly and you want to give more slack (AXSM, for example) consider selling a small portion but still looking to finance a portion of risk asap. This is always tough b/c when it happens this quickly, you're forced to make a decision quickly. I find that selling the smallest amount possible to finance nearly all of risk makes the most sense. B/c in the moment, you don't want to sell too much of a stock that's making a nice move, so simply look to sell as little as possible. If the stock is slowly chugging up, however, consider looking to sell half around 1:1 so you can cushion any 1-day drop which happens so frequently.. It might not be the perfect plan. That's perfectly ok. Just have a plan, stick to it, and you can go back later and critique through PTA. Even if you did have the perfect plan, you wouldn't know it until PTA confirms it anyway... Until you can go back and confirm with PTA that you're selling too soon, you shouldn't be concerned about capturing the 'big move.' 

Capturing the majority of the upside is one of my emotional weaknesses. It's almost more difficult for me to sell a winner and watch it continue than it is take a loss. Taking a loss and it continues lower = "glad I had a stop", loss that comes back = "but managing risk is #1". Sell a winner and it moves lower = "I'm a genius. Beauty in the rearview mirror." Sell a winner and it moves higher = "I knew it. I missed out." Why is it so much easier to take a loss? That means I'm assigning more emotional turmoil to making money than losing it. That's stupid. I start my unfortunate loser thought with a 'but'. So, one way to think when selling a winner and it continues higher is, "but I got a multiple of my risk and successfully turned over my edge. What happens after I sell means nothing. It's a win becuase I made a multiple of my risk, not b/c it went down after I sold. That's the mental shift that needs to happen.

I'm not very good at interpreting the feedback of my stocks. I find that I will buy a couple of names, they'll work, but not really enough to allow me to cushion myself. Meanwhile, on balance things appear to be working and I proceed to buy another name or two. Perhaps one will stop me out but I think, "3 of 4 doing well, things are working on balance." Until, in a matter of 1-2 days, it all stops working. If I'm lucky, I'll get 1 or 2 names that work. At best, I have cushioned my losses, but on average, I'm unable to cushion them all and I'm losing money on balance. It's tough to interpret b/c conditions are never the exact same as time advances and my plan is now influenced by the feedback/information that I've received between my initial purchases and my most recent purchases. 

Remember what MM said, "The most common reason for overtrading is when people are buying good setups in a bad market." The setups must be working!

Mark stated today that, "Most traders lose money." Most traders do not beat the S&P500.

Fewer stocks on Focus list this week but still more than usual. Many names either already moved up and extended or have started correcting after moves up. Names like AVGO, ONTO, look like they may have put in short to intermediate-term tops.

There are several group moves to note: homebuilders, semiconductors, packaged tech., trucking, materials, auto stores. Seeing good action coming from many names in these groups. That said, participation has been lackluster and many of these names have been challenging to get on. They also moved out first with little to no confirmation of things working beforehand. Semiconductors look ready to pause for a little while longer. Some names have little PB's forming but weekly charts look extended and things haven't been working on balance. Additionally, market internals confirming individual stock feedback with breadth deteriorating and new high's decreasing, etc. It's time to be cautious.

We need to see stocks hold up during this pullback as well as more setups emerging. Right now we're seeing a correction in the general market and individual names are still selective. Several names on focus list got clobbered last week: AVDL, APLS, VYGR, AI, ROIV, BLMN, HKIT just to name a few. This highlights the risky environment but we also need to stay engaged and diligent. Do things crumble underneath the surface or will we see a normal pullback followed by more stocks continuing as well as breaking out? I'm optimistic of the latter, but we must wait and see. Certainly feels like a new bull is here.. but still challenging and quite selective. Hoping things will begin working on balance soon. Looking for a spot to buy into this pullback with '401k' money.

Going into this week my focus is to simply follow the rules and go into each day with a plan that I follow. If this is a new bull, there is plenty of time. For now, things haven't been working too well, but also haven't been terrible. I would likely be slight above b/e if it weren't for my MRVL and ASML trades. Both of which were a stretch at a time when getting cute isn't worth while.

Message of market: money is going mainly to big cap, defensive names. Much less appetite for risk right now. IWM lagging way behind. Look for support on IWM around 200-day during this correction. IF IWM breaks down, look out! This would be surprising to me considering the buying that came in a couple of weeks ago... IWO looks slightly better..

Watching weekend study session- up/down volume ratio went to neutral today. This surprised me. Noticed IWM volume went red last week and SPY at 1.1. Things definitely getting worse but most readings are still blue besides the IWM and IWO ratios. Just something to note for analysis purposes.

Last Friday was "Russell 2000 Rebalancing" day. This explains the major volume in many names on that day.

Marks largest winners are between 30-50%. Usually takes profits between 8-12%. If playing very short term, might take profits at 3, 5, or 6%. Just depends on what the market is providing at any given time.

Mark's number 1 indicator is feedback from HIS stocks. Number 2 is feedback from stocks on the Buy Ready list. These are stocks in our universe- how are they acting? These two things account for ~90% of Mark's 'feel' for how the market is. The other 10% is how are the indexes doing, up/down volume, new highs/lows, etc. The other 10% is usually just confirming what he's seeing in the individual stocks.

Reflection on week:

Several things to note:
Looking at my paper trading account, I can see a shift from purchases made in middle of May to beginning of June. 

Middle of May, I bought LVS, TJX, DUOL, MA, LTH, MRK. 


Spoke with my dad today and believe I had a very important epiphany:

When doing PTA, I oftentimes conduct mini-studies, as if I can find some magic piece of information that would have warned me or given me a heads up about the result of the trade. This seems logical but it's a terrible mindset b/c it opens the doors to infinitely many possibilities and leads to over analyzing and trying to be perfect. Instead of developing a new theory every week to back-test my results against, <b> the only thing I need to ask is if I followed my rules of not. </b> When I think in the frame of mind that "I must have missed something and need to do PTA to find my mistakes." This leads to a general feeling of uncertainty. Simply because I'm asking the completely wrong question. Eliminate feeling uncertain. Are you certain you followed your rules?

Why is it true that this is the only necessary question?

Even during an easy dollar environment, the most you can expect your batting average to be is ~60%. That means that even at it's best, this strategy is correct barely 50% of the time. Therefore, just because a trade didn't work, doesn't mean it's necessary or even possible to go back and nitpick it to provide any clarity. It just simply doesn't work all the time. If you don't follow your rules, you open yourself up to the possibility that something (that occurs at high probability) IS there and that something truly IS faulty and worthy of inspection. Instead of opening that door of infinitely many possibilities, close it by simply following your rules. When the rules are followed, rules that have been time-tested for decades by proven champions in the market, it becomes the judge and the jury. There's nothing else to consider because I TRUST MY STRATEGY. Did you follow the rules? Yes. Then listen to the feedback and act accordingly. No. Then correct your mistake ASAP or recognize the mistake and vouch to never make it again. If you don't follow rules, you don't have a strategy. If you don't have a strategy, you're doomed in the market. Sometimes rules get bent, and that's an area that will simply take time and experience to master. As a newbie, the more rules the better.

This is indisputable proof that the ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS FOLLOWING YOUR RULES.

Another issue that I'm encountering as I'm at a new part of the market continuum is FOMO. I experience FOMO because it feels like my strategy is limiting me from buying stocks that are moving and look great. Stocks like UBER, MNDY, SHOP, for example. I guess I want action and I don't want to miss out. I need to, at a subconscious level, realize that thinking risk first and following my rules is more important than filling my short-term desire to get excited about new merchandise. I need to remind myself of these points as the week progresses. I do a good job thinking this way Sunday, Monday.. Come Thursday, I typically haven't done a ton of work during the week except for my daily scans, and I need to make habit to check in and remind myself of these bigger picture ideas more frequently. Is this why Mark say's he wakes up every day and looks in the mirror to remind himself that "he has the ability to do great harm to himself today." It's a daily thing. Make it this way.

<b>CREATE A LIST OF THINGS TO REMIND YOURSELF OF ON A DAILY BASIS. Must read this list before each trading day. Absolute must. What do I struggle with and need to be reminded of?</b>

(1) Close the door of uncertainty by FOLLOWING THE RULES.
(2) NO FOMO. This is a business. What business would succeed if the owner was giving into short-term desires/excitement instead of executing according to plan? Would you work for him/her?
(3) What has been happening to you in the market?
(4) Buying stocks that don't meet the criteria is proof of FOMO, desire for excitement, and/or thinking reward first. Otherwise, what's the purpose of the strategy?
(5) Be a professional.

ALWAYS REMEMBER WITH PB BUYS: Look for the good close the day before. Didn't get it on PCVX. Watch for this!

Forcing trades is very normal early on in your career, b/c you want to be in there and to make money, and the number of forced trades will decrease as you gain more experience but recognize that YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FORCING TRADES to some degree. It'll never be perfect. Because we're dealing with incomplete information. You're not looking to get it perfect, and you almost never will. That's why we use progressive exposure and have many tactics (cheats, low cheats, handle, etc.) to get onboard.

Getting the base is just step 1. Next, and VERY IMPORTANTLY, you need to see follow-through. I went back and noticed both VC and VTYX had several days of buying after the breakout. How many stocks did I own that brokeout but lacked multiple days of follow through? Did the majority end up stopping me out? Very important thing to ascertain and MARK emphasizes this frequently.. This time it registered.

The STEM model on Orange is sort of where Mark feels it lives the vast majority of the time. He also trades like the orange model describes, being very selective and some will work. He's always thinking in this way. Always cautious. Even when green, still cautious but being aggressive with sizing. 

Mark Ritchies take: 50% to 66% of time you're on orange, or "riding the break." The other times ~25% or less, you're in red, or in "park." Or either stomping on the accelerator, only 10-20% of the time.

<b> Your goal as a trader is to get 1-2 opportunities per year to make big money and simply manage the risk the rest of the time. Every now and again, 4-5 years, you'll have a standout year where you'll make 100's of % points. And then you have years where you're up 30%, 50%, 70% or so and some where you'll be down slightly. You can make HUGE money this way over time. The main goal is to not be down while things are not working. Mitigating risk takes out HUGE problems that you'd encounter by just trying to return to breakeven if you had large drawdowns. </b>

I need to go in with a more robust plan. I rely too much on MPA and make decisions mid-day. Developing a bad habit of dependency and I'm realizing I'm not coming up with a solid, executable plan prior to the market opening. BE MORE INDEPENDENT. It's ok to check Focus list with Mark's but shouldn't be taking ideas and executing mid-day without having thought about them in advance. HAVE A PLAN. Consider turning notifications off for MPA.

I think I have a problem with over trading.. I'm looking at my two losers on the week and they were two of the sub optimal setups I chose to buy. I also realize I have a tendency to make decisions on the spot, mid-day. I look for the MPA focus list and let that influence my buy candidates.. Not to a major degree, but I'm realizing I have this tendency in my process and it's not good. I should have a plan going in and it's ok to check that with the MPA plan, but it's not ok to buy just because one of the Mark's pointed it out and I dont want to miss out. I need to be more methodical in my approach and trust my approach. It's better to have a less-than-perfect vacuum packed process than try and do everything perfectly on the fly.

Another issue I'm realizing in my process that seems to happen over and over again.. I will buy stock setups and some work and some dont. What about those setups that are working that I didn't buy? I let these 'other' stocks work their way into my thinking / conviction about how things are going. I have a tendency to ignore the couple that didn't work / ignore the effect on my portfolio.. meanwhile, I'll have a couple that are working that are keeping my portfolio near breakeven.. Then, most don't work and in hindsight I realize that I jumped in too soon. I need to have a more vaccuum packed and preplanned process where I have a select # of names I can put on. I put them on and ignore the rest. All that matters is what's in my portfolio and the feedback I get from them. If they don't work, go back and double check your criteria. If you made good buys, and they aren't working on balance, you know you need to be cautious. I must have a predetermined amount of money that I'm willing to risk and a plan - should I use a shotgun approach to reach that risk or be more concentrated? These must be planned in advance and until you have back stopped or booked profits, YOU CANNOT LET OTHER THINGS INFLUENCE YOU.

My Focus list is full of names in Biotech, Software Technology, Health Technology, Pharmaceuticals.

Added to TGTX today and bought ASML. ASML was bought in the afternoon, around 1pm. Stopped on MBLY early morning on news of secondary public offering of $42 per share. Seeing some traction in names and all positions are green except ASML which is basically even. ASML closed low in range yesterday.. would like to have seen it close high the day before. Still great setup.

Today seemed to confirm that yesterday was just a needed pullback. Everything opened low and continued lower early morning. I was down slightly all morning on VERX and TGTX. It felt like it slowly clawed its way back all day and by the close all my positions closed strong as well as the general market. IWM and IWO got a pullback this morning and recovered slowly all day as well. Closed just below yesterdays close and strong action overall. 

Several objective measures have improved: General market - both NAS and IWM. % stocks above 200-day improving. It spiked up this week. VIX at levels that it hasnt been since Feb. 2020 - just before COVID! It's hard not to feel like an easy dollar environment is just right around the corner. Day by day. Patience and progressive exposure is key. If I can backstop or log profits in the names I currently own, and if we see more waves of setups and current breakouts holding, I will double my position sizes.

Bought TGTX and VERX today. Both closed down very slightly from purchase price. Was up nearly the whole day on TGTX and down nearly the whole day on VERX. 

Check out weekly chart of APLS. WOW! How does it play out from here?

I wrote / thought that VERX was "riding both 20 and 50 DMA" and that this was cause for concern. Check back on the result and if this potentially did hint at a problem.

VERX was bought after the breakout squatted on a late morning reversal. It remained above pivot but squatted ~6-7%. Should this have forced me to stay out or was it wise to buy the squat reversal?

Tons of downside reversals today. Feels like many extended names got a needed correction and then some... Feels like today could be the first warning sign that the market is still the same as it has been.. Still selective but definitely feels like its broadening.

Breadth CLEARLY moving out on the risk curve. IWM excellent action with 3 huge pillars of volume during last 4 sessions. Just what we want to see. And while the QQQs and SPY have already run up and are now taking a little break. JUST WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. Now, see if my recent buys can hold and my other names continue. Paper trading acct mostly green and names looking great. Along with more stocks setting up and follow through. If these names can hold up and we see another wave of setups emerge, I will bring money in from LiveOak Bank and increase portfolio size & position size.

Paper trading account summary: green on 5, b/e on 3, down on 2.

Last two days there has been a positive divergence between the QQQ's and NASD % stocks above 200.. First time it hasnt either been a negative divergence or in lock-step for quite sometime. Small positive developments.

After running through weekend screens - participation definitely looks to be broadening. Seeing leadership qualities in Semiconductors, biotech, healthcare, and several technology-related sectors. Lots of ideas on deck, where they caught support last week and are forming cheats in handles or look like they could start forming cheats within handles. Next week will be huge. How do these setups act? How do recent breakouts act? Paper trading account has 6 names, in the green on 4 and great looking breakouts in VRRM & LECO. IMGN and AME very solid. GLD doing its thing.. looks like it could breakdown.SWAV looks OK. <b>VRRM, LECO, AME all had nice breakouts recently and have held up 1-2 days. We've seen MANY stocks "pop and squat" for 1-3 days. Will these do the same or will they point to a change in theme? </b>

If setups and recent breakouts can hold up and/or improve into early next week, some buys and small positions are warranted. Futhermore, IWM, IWO had great days on Friday. Breadth made a nice jump. VIX put in 2-year low. And most importantly, some new leadership appears to have made itself known (semi's) and are holding up, and more names are showing up. Still too early to jump in but could be right around the corner if we continue to see supportive action. Am I too eager? That's what usually happens. How many more setups / waves of setups until we have enough conviction? Observing and listening to Mark's closely. That said, Stock Feedback Model still on Red. Need to see stocks breakout for more than 1-3 days. Still waiting to hear Mark's take... <b>Mark understands that things take longer than 1-week to develop in the market. The reality is that 37% of stocks are above their 200-day MA yet the NAS is running up. He is short-term bearish on the market because of this trend. What has happened in the past when the general market pulls back? I get stopped out! It's time to be CAREFUL and be patient. Nothing has changed yet and participation is still thin.</b>

TGTX 30% decline after huge runup but looks like it's turning up here. Keep an eye on this- does it work?

Refresh on PowerPlay rules: Stock advances 100% or more in less than 8 weeks. Subsequently, the stock moves sideways in a relatively tight range, correcting no more than 20-25% over a period of 3-6 weeks. 2 weeks minimum. Lastly, stock must develop a pivot that moves within a trading range of 10% or less.

Realized today that I still somehow have access to Stockcharts.com (follow this link ![https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=%24COMPQ&p=D&yr=2&mn=0&dy=0&id=p01078549976&a=1391899692&listNum=33]. Turns out % Nas stocks above 200-day is only 37%. Huge divergence between major averages.. Mark says he's short-term bearish if this continues.

Random Note: Mark started trading at 18 years old, in the 1980's.

Nearly 1000 names on Up on Volume scan today. 10% have RS > 90, 90% have RS < 90. I think this is how it should be and makes perfect mathematical sense. Check in on this idea on future days.

risk > traction > chart > fundamentals

VRRM example of perfect handle. Why you start a position on PB buy and add on BO.

Tiny breakout on NCTH breaking above downward trend line. IDT this means much at all as the % of stocks above 200-day is still very low, but the BO above the trendline is interesting. Does this lead to anything? 

IWM, IWO, FFTY all gap ups today. IWM up over 3% midday! Will these hold? VIX put in 2-year low today.

Trading plan: Go into Monday next week with pause. Can stocks hold up after Monday morning? Tuesday morning? If so, consider buying breakouts.

Terrible action again today. Wouldn't be surprised if I got stopped out of DUOL and LTH soon. Just letting them work. Financed most of risk on DUOL and already sold 2/3 of LTH. Waiting for a pullback in the market. Mark says, if we get a breather in the market, it would not surprise him if stocks started acting well during or subsequent to a pullback. 

Not seeing setups. Volatility around breakouts still too high. Would be down on pretty much everything in paper trading account.. Same shit.

Big negative divergence on NASDAQ stocks above 200-day MA and QQQ's. Russel 2000 lagging big time and still hanging around bear market low's. Staying away until see something change. Not worth risking any capital in this market.

Corrected my mistake from last week and sold 1 share of DUOL almost immediately at open just above 1:1. Now I just need to ensure I consitently apply these rules. Is the perfect tactic? Probably not, but it will help me improve and I can critique it later. Also, if this is indeed a transitional phase, let the market tell me first. It takes more than one small win in NVDA to gain enough conviction. Have patience. Things take time..

Still maximum defensive posture. Should have sold 1 share of DUOL into strength at 1:1. <b>Didn't follow my rules.</b> Looking to correct this mistake on Monday if 1:1 still available.

After taking some time this weekend to think and reflect about my activity in the market last week, I feel like, once again, I got a little too excited and eager to enter the market and put on exposure. I let the market indexes pressure me once again. This time, breakouts from 6-week consolidations and all looks good, however, THE INDEXES DONT MATTER. I must be more patient and less inclined to add exposure until things truly are working, which takes more than 1-2 names to work to determine. PATIENCE. PATIENCE. PATIENCE.

I have $75 of risk in the market. This is too much considering how poorly the feedback has been for me. Selling 1 share of DUOL at 1:1 would bring the risk down to 63.

<u>Goals to set in Market:</u>

(1) Not Losing Money

(2) Consistent application of discipline

Thinking about something Mark said in the Q&A session on Friday.. One of your main goals in the market should be to apply your discipline consistently. Even if your discipline is not perfect, it's important that you apply it consistently. Then, after doing that for some time, you can go through and critique / improve your discipline to achieve superperformance. This is super relevant b/c last week I was questioning my decision to sell 1:1 to finance risk, thinking, "we'll it only reduces my risk by $12 and I already have a small position." This, however, is not congruent with my goal. I need to be less concerned with having perfect rules than I am about doing something consistently. It's ok if financing risk 1:1 isn't perfect, I already know it will improve my numbers, but it's ok if not perfect. Just do it and do it consistently. Then, after a few months, look back and critique it. You should do this over and over and eventually you will have 'critiqued' everything about your strategy.

Bought LTH and bought back TJX. LTH maybe slightly early but very strong action and reaction to earnings, and some of these names have 'just been going' so I started a posn here. Did I buy right into the volatility? TJX moving back through the pivot and I added back. Mistake? More semi's blasting off today.

DUOL RS blue dot today. DUOL hit 1:1 today, I only had 3 shares and decided to hold on. I'm feeling guilty immediately post-market b/c I didn't follow the rules of financing risk ASAP, but my posn size is already so low it would have booked me ~$6 and reduced risk to 6, instead of 18. 12 dollar difference. It's such a small dollar amount it hardly feels worth making all these moves. General market broke out of 6 week tight consolidation. And NVDA just continued higher on volume after I sold. For all these reasons, I decided to hold on and NOT finance risk asap. Is this just another example of me feeling like "this time is different" and I get spanked AND don't sell at 1:1 to finance risk? We will see. Either way, I accept the risk and feel it is very small. Perhaps I shouldn't have some blanket rule to sell everything 1:1 when my posn size is already so small (that's the predicament I face when financing risk). Maybe it would be better to employ that rule when I'm not doing well but only during a small correction where posn size may be relatively light, but not micro like they are now. IDK we will see.

FISV looks amazing but it's a regional bank stock and it's been riding the 20-day SMA. Hasn't rode the 20 like this since the start of the year. Is this a warning sign or am I reading into this 'riding' too much?

Bought TJX, DUOL, and MA today. TJX mid-day retraced entire breakout on earnings. Sold ~1/2 as it retraced entire move. Will it recover? Notice on weekly chart: greater down volume on left side of base than right. Was this a warning?

Sold remainder of NVDA into strength at 3R. Total trade just over 2R. Very small win but much needed psychologically. Covered a couple of small losses. With more exposure on, now we need to see.. will these positions work too? If so, could be time to bring more $ into portfolio. One step. One day at a time. No FOMO. In the front of my mind is: "What has been happening lately?" Not what I want to happen as I get excited about buying...

Semi's as a whole have been blasting off and getting huge bids. Couple days in a row now. Great sign!

PTA so valuable! Did PTA over the weekend and realized I should be financing risk ASAP (even 1:1). Today, I sold 1/2 NVDA slightly above 1:1 and now I can hold remainder for bigger move. Felt wrong selling at ~3.5% gain but you have to adjust as Mark says. And as I've come to understand, avg gain doesn't mean shit when you're losing $! Finance risk is priority #1.

Breadth has been absolutely atrocious. Not playing any games. Maximum caution posture.

Had a revelation today:

<b> DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE % GAIN, FINANCE THE RISK ASAP </b>

This idea that I want to sell at "a decent gain" is what keeps me from financing my risk ASAP. In the moment, I always think: "I don't want to sell at 2, 3, 5% gain, that's too low!" In a market like this, forget about the % gain and finance risk when available. Free trade is the most important thing right now, not average gain! Only after you notice that financing your risk is costing you money should you switch to holding for a larger (normal size) move. 

In a bear market, financing risk should be #1 priority. Average gain does not matter. NEW BEAR MARKET RULES: finance risk at 1:1 and free roll remainder, or stay out. I will forever live by these rules. All it takes is one wave of setups to continue higher (where financing risk costs you money) to be able to hold for normal (bigger) moves. But until you see that happening, you MUST finance risk at 1:1. Either way you should be smaller posn., so what are your other options? Do nothing different? Short? No, it only makes sense to adjust your expected upside.

Going back to Special Session #1 in PTA (audio 1, ~7 mins): when it's not working, you're being summoned to sit out or adjust. If you're new, don't adjust too much. Minimal moving parts.

***

Stopped on LVS today. Tons of early morning reversals. Much of the same. Had considered selling 1/2 LVS with poor action all day yesterday and <u>with close below 20-day MA</u> and I should have. This has worked more often than not and should be a rule that is adhered to unless very tight action and barely below MA. 

Seeing quite a few stocks setting up or on the "On Deck" list. Could be buyable here soon but market action and stock participation has been poor. Can't get any real traction going. Feeling like I should have financed risk on NVDA sooner with even a 1:1 trade. Tough to take any profits at 2.5% though. 

I need to be taking winners sooner. The upside just isn't there. My avg gain is quite high, but this is why my batting average is scary low (8.6%). How often does a +10% winner come along? Clearly very infrequently. I need to be using this more as a gauge to help make decisions.

Some reflection on my results: be very short-term or stay out; either way be very small and conservative. After going through my ~30 trades, I can conclusively say this is a ping-pong market with no real traction happening from breakouts. If you don't shorten your timeframe and sell quickly to finance risk, you're losing money. Stocks setup and either move sideways for a while, fail shortly after, or provide you with little gain that shortly evaporates. VERY few names have actually broken out and worked. The problem I can see is that I'm not altering my strategy to account for this shorter-timeframe. I don't want to alter too many things from the way Mark has taught me. I feel this is the right call, but I need to be even smaller. It seems each time things start moving, I find a reason to risk ~20 per trade, which after taking 2-3 positions, stings a little. This death by a thousand cuts still leads to death..

Experiencing a good period and seeing/feeling what it's supposed to be like when it works is everything I need. In hindsight, I can speculate as to why things didn't work, but in real-time, each new wave of setups is as appealing as the last. And even though I always tell myself I'll be super conservative (and I am), it still hurts to go through this several times. I'm down like $600 and its been a slow, light bleed for months. I'm ultimately down ~2% on my overall portfolio and I think this is very acceptable. No one wants to lose money, but without much experience, I'm just applying myself and sticking to the tactics. It's tough because stocks ~50% of the time will return to the breakout and kind of dick around a little bit. When I'm in these trades, I stay hopeful and think about how frequent it is for them to return to the b/o and simply look for violations. Is there any way to know things are going south without actual violations? I don't think so. I don't think it possible to have a solid "feel" while looking at things so myopically like that. I think it has more to do with, "What have stocks been doing?" Have they been working, or not? Are you up on your account, or not? I think these are the "Umbrella" type gauges I need to focus on. No one trade will ever tell me enough. So when in a trade, don't be so myopic and hopeful. Have things been working? If not, look outside the trade and act accordingly. Look outside/beyond the trade and adjust accordingly. Just like you can't "know" to exit a trade because it isn't doing X, Y, and Z in some particular order (can only respond to violations); you can't enter trades and get overly hopeful just because it did X, Y, or Z. When market is bad, it can all turn around very quickly. Be patient and assess, what is happening to me on average?

<u>Even Mark still has to apply himself and simply act as the caboose. He doesn't know things aren't working based on 1-2 days of action so how can I? He doesn't necessarily shorten timeframe and make tons of adjustments.  Apply yourself.. be micro or be out.. don't make too many adjustments.. when the results start speaking to you, listen.. adjust when necessary.</u>

<b> Noticing many names that are riding the 20-day MA</b> Names like LVS, ONON, KNSL, WSO, PODD, likely many more. Is this an early warning sign or not a big deal? Check back later.

On NVDA and LVS. Both stocks came in today but doing nothing wrong. Up on NVDA, down on LVS. Breadth of market deteriorating and negative divergence occurring between QQQ and NCTH. Concerning that market is being held up by few names. How long can this last? Feels like I could be getting stopped out soon. Considered selling 1/2 of LVS today w/ close below 20-day.

Quite a few pullback buy setups: ONON, IR, PTGX, BMEA. Really like the idea of playing PTGX and BMEA, serious HP under the hood, but likely won't b/c market condition. Maybe if I don't get stopped or if they set up perfectly. KNSL setting up nicely. Being patient and remaining disciplined.

Starting to like Deepvue as a screener at least. Luckily I still have access to TV. started using "Up on volume" and "Down on volume" screens today to gauge market action. Was insightful (more down all day) and easy to use.

<u>Comment from Mark M. yesterday:</u>

The market looks like it's about to make another move lower, however Open Positions are holding up just fine. This looks like a little shakeout on the right side of the general market (happened in 1990 and 2000) and is ultimately just building out the right side. SPY and QQQ's look perfectly fine and many stocks as open positions are up and holding up. LOOK FOR MORE SETUPS and watch the open positions. This looks like the start of a transition in the market.

Lot's of decisions today. In hindsight, I was too impatient and eager and wound up putting on more risk than I was comfortable with. I start with micro positions but as things progress, they turn to small positions. These small positions, when they all come in at once, end up amounting to more risk than I'm comfortable with. I should have never added to MBLY, AGYS, PODD, HUBS. I should have sat with my original micro position. Mark never posted an 'add' buy on any of these stocks. I'm too impatient and I want things to happen too fast. That said, I learned something very important today about the MPA platform: Mark does not "buy 90% of the stocks that are on the platform" like he said he does. He stated today that while there are currently 17-18 open positions on the platform that, himself and Mark Ritchie, are only in a handful of them. Typically 4-5 names at once. 

<b>I 100% have been over interpreting the MPA platform. I let the buys on the platform influence how I feel (or how 'aggressive' I should be getting) but now that I know that Mark isn't over here buying up all these names, I need to tone it down and truly become vacuum packed. Listed strictly to the feedback from the stocks. Ensure the criteria is good and get the feedback. If they aren't working, stop buying. Don't find ways to add to positions or think it's time to step on the gas just because the platform is putting on buys. MPA is simply highlighting good setups for us (students) to identify. It all comes down to personal portfolio feedback and personal risk tolerance. There will be plenty of time. I will not miss a thing!</b>

Institutions are still selling right into the pop to ATH on many names. No apatite for risk. Retail traders buy these breakouts and institutions take the easy $.

Looking back in my journal from previous weeks, SOOOO many names broke down that had either just broken out or were setting up. Always pay attention to recent breakouts. <b> When things are setting up and I'm considering buying, continue to make lists of good setups / breakouts and monitor them. Add them to the new watchlist in tradingview called "Paper" as in a paper trading account. </b>

MBLY earnings coming out on 4/27 in morning!

1. HUBS bearish engulfing and sold all throughout the day. Breakeven result which I am happy with buy not so happy about how I got there: I only had one share so I couldn't sell partial at 1R (though it was achieved) to finance risk. Under normal circumstances, I would still be holding a partial position in this stock with derisked. Either way happy with not losing money but tactics, tactics, tactics.

2. Sold all of RETA today to simply take a win and cover a few of the many small losses I have taken. Very much needed psychologically. Very few stocks are actually holding up and I didn't want to give any back. Small 5% gain but the market hasnt given me much more.

3. Sold half of AGYS today as the volatility somewhat picked back up (although I added more shares right into the volatility last week). In hindsight, I shouldn't have made that add. FOMO decision.

4. Sold half of PODD today as the volatility in the pivot has been widening. Doesn't look right and it was my largest position with 33 risk. The right decision. Still holding half. 

5. Sold 1/3 of MBLY today to take a small, psychological win. Only ~5.9% gain but I needed to take some off the table with the way my portfolio has been acting. Results say 4.3% gain because average cost but I looked at it as selling a portion of my original purchase. 

6. Sold the QQQ's today as I was uncomfortable with the amount of risk I was carrying. Nasdaq breadth has been deteriorating (all last week was poor breadth) and I'm not prepared to stick around. The pivot basically went drifted down from where I bought and the volume was fairly heavy within the drifting area.

Feedback from stocks has been a mixed bag. Portfolio is about half and half with stocks above and below my buy point. Stopped on ACLS and EXTR while others have held up but not giving much gain greater than 5% or so. Overall, an improvement from previous weeks but not enough to warrant getting aggressive. Market is still highly selective and there's certainly no broad-based participation. Also, still highly rotational. Need to close some gains before taking on more risk. <b> According to Mark, market pullbacks will be very telling and this is where the rubber meets the road. Pay attention to the volatility, participation, and feedback from stocks. </b>

Mark has 18 open positions on the platform, yet he owns virtually none of them and is super conservative here. This is surprising and a reminder that the MPA platform is not a model portfolio.

ASUR is a perfect example of why Mark say's these run ups (non-power play) with short bases are ok for trades but not for longer holds. Oftentimes volatile after making such a large move up. 

QQQ's 3 tight weekly closes in a row on lower than average volume. SPY 4 (fairly) tight weekly closes in a row on decreased volume. Appears to be very constructive!

Mixed action today. Half my positions are up and doing well, half are down but not doing much wrong.

Important Lesson: Many homebuilders were setting up and for whatever reason (the fact that they're homebuilders?) I stayed away. They ALL brokeout and are making very nice moves: LEN, TOL, GRBK, MHO, MTH. <b>Never again will I pass on stocks when many names in the group are setting up.</b>

~7% move today in MBLY. RETA moving up and closed above 99. Bought ACLS today and am down slightly - squatted. AGYS returned to b/o area on lighter volume than b/o - looks fine. EXTR looks like it could stop me out.. Base symmetry. HUBS looks like it's setting up another buy point but b/c minimal traction I won't be adding. PODD flat and doing nothing wrong.

% stocks above 200MA decreasing today along with A/D, more decliners than advancers. Small caps doing the worst - is this surprising considering what Weinstein said in his book about the beginning of a bear market (money goes into more 'trustworthy' names)? New Highs vs New Lows continuing to improve. Overall, seeing some positive developments for sure but the market feels like a field full of land mines. Not an environment to get aggressive just yet. Could be right around the corner.

Good action today from individual names. Currently holding 6 stocks: PODD, AGYS, MBLY, RETA, HUBS, EXTR as well as both the SPY and QQQ. Total risk is 134 and I've already lost 113 in the month of April. $247 total 'risk' so far in April. That's nearly 2% risk of total equity. Disregarding the major indexes (SPY and QQQ), open individual stock risk is 87 or 200 total for the month of April. 

2 names that are VERY enticing: LSCC and ACLS. Top stocks in top groups. 

FFTY HUGE accumulation volume today.. Keep an eye on this for Adri.

<b> IGNORE THE INDEXES </b>

SNPS an example of why <b> you must buy right in a bear market. </b> Buying perfectly at 379 would have allowed for a 1:1 trade where I could have financed my risk. I bought slightly late at 382. B/c of this, my risk was slightly higher at ~4.5% and the gain I actually achieved over the first 2-days was only ~2.5%. Had I bought perfectly, it would have been ~3.5% both ways, enabling me to sell half to finance the risk. 

Another thing I'm realizing is that I haven't had plans for selling partials into strength. I need to have set areas (with alerts?) where I am prompted to sell a portion if the market allows. My energy and focus has been finding new stocks to buy, with little regard for how to manage my positions IF THEY WORK. <b> Have a plan for every possible outcome. </b>

Good breakouts to watch. Follow through? INGR, MTD, FIVE

I am learning why the "early turns" are less favorable to Mark and O'neill. Many of the names that formed mini VCP's from early turns ultimately failed and needed more time.

Note: I chose not to buy MKTX on 4/4/2023 because the leaders of the group: IBKR, SNEX, both broke hard 3-days in a row on elevated volume on 3/9/2023. This does indeed seem to have alluded to the trouble that MKTX ultimately got into. <b> Watch the leaders </b>

Compare the QQQ's to the % of stocks above their 200-day & 50-day moving averages. We can see that while the QQQ's have been rallying, far less stocks have been participating recently. This divergence is a huge red flag especially for the stocks that we traffic in. FFTY RS made a new low.

When to start getting aggressive? When you can look back at your last 4-5 trades and they are doing well.

RVNC another example of the danger of this market - gets clobbered as soon as it emerges from good buy point.

<b>After taking a step back, a few hours after the market closed, I realized that today I experienced FOMO because of the indexes. Recognize it and correct it.</b> Who cares if the Nasdaq is moving up, the stocks in my wheelhouse are not behaving well. Stay focused and don't get distracted by this man-made index.

I've done two experimental things over the last two days and curious how this plays out. EXTR was showing serious RS yesterday so I decided to risk $1 to keep an eye on it. Today, it's lower that where I bought it and it's not showing RS. The lesson is 1-day doesn't mean much - I believe this is what Mark would tell me. 

The second experimental decision I made was to buy HUBS on a pullback to the breakout area today. This rarely works but as always, this time seems different: it's starting a new stage 2 uptrend according to Stan Weinstein and has been among some of the better names during this rally. I missed the breakout on 3/29 and it was on my radar. The pullback looks fairly constructive so I decided to buy 1 share. It's an older, big-cap tech company (QQQ doing the best of all indexes), showing a VCP, new stage 2 uptrend, and fundamentals are A+. I figured why not, but can't deny that I feel very guilty. It's not a pullback buy according to Minervini. The pattern looks so enticing and big tech has been outperforming. 

Other names that are starting stage 2 uptrends and are also very enticing: MELI, WDAY, FOUR, NEWR.

I think to some degree I am feeling FOMO. There are many names that are setup and still look buyable, if not now very soon, like: RVNC, SGML, MNST, PODD, PMTS, GRBK, IRDM, LNTH, ASML, CROX, TMUS, GFS, HLIT, HSTM. I've been stopped out of 4 of 6 positions, although it feels like it should be 3 of 5 b/c ASUR shouldn't have been bought. Is 2 for 5 is just under half.. Should I strictly listen to this and stop buying with many names still set up? Here's what I think the answer is: yes, I should be listening to the feedback from open positions and stop buying. I have a feeling we'll be seeing more volatility in names like HUBS, MELI, FOUR, and that perhaps I just bought into the snapback rally to the breakout. I will likely get stopped out of SNPS and RETA. There have been enough names that have broken down to make me think they'll get em all eventually. If that doesn't happen however, I believe this would allude to the fact that you have to stay on the ball. Half might stop you out (as Mark says) and you have to keep watching to see if more stocks break down than hold up.. Only time will tell, but lessons will be learned for a small fee.

Will I learn to never do this again or are these new stage 2 uptrends really under accumulation as they appear?

Stock feedback Model leaning closer to red. Still holding SNPS and RETA but down slightly on both. Bought 1 share of EXTR to keep an eye on this stock that was showing serious RS today in a sea of red. Slightly early but developing a low cheat. Many stocks were volatile today and overall I'd say the action was concerning. My list of names that are setup and ready to buy is expanding, which is feeling contradictory. I'm basically down on 50% of names. ASUR wasn't the best buy.. Mark says this is normal to see some (half) of your stocks experiencing volatility during a pullback in the market. This makes me think I should be very selective and cautious but to still pay very close attention b/c buying some breakouts could be worthwhile if the market can hold up. Tomorrow the rubber will meet the road for many stocks.

That said, the SPY has been very orderly. QQQ distribution day but overall fairly constructive. IWO low volume pullback so far. VIX still below 20. 

<b>Stocks showing RS:</b> IRDM, LNTH, PODD, LEN, MHO, MNST, TMUS, TR, GLD, EXTR, PMTS, RVNC, RMBS.

Tried ASUR today and got stopped mid-day. Stopped on WING & ASO too. <b> For this current rally, I'm only up on 2 of 6 stocks. </b>This feedback, along with the volatility in many names today feels like a shot across the brow. Have seen this too many times to not take seriously. Glad I was conservative with 1% total equity risk. Two thoughts on this rally / my stocks: was WING really that great of a setup to warrant double the risk from my other positions? ASUR was a short base in a continuation move with 99 RS. Maybe buying the day after a perceived shakeout wasn't the best idea. Looking back at FIVE, which had a shakeout confirmed by Mark, you can see it shookout on 3/24/2023 and remained tight and constructive. He bought it days later on 3/31. Either way, idt there's anything wrong with a small starter position in ASUR today (which is what I placed) but it's a good reminder to let the trade come to you and be patient. Only thing I would change is to take half the position in WING that I took. This would have been ~$25 risk which is what I took on my other positions.

IWM and FFTY wide down days. IWM looks terrible and makes me think focusing on liquid big-caps is the best way to go. Many liquid names look best as well as QQQ's being one of the best indexes. I think it's very well still possible that most indexes have bottomed as there are plenty of names that broke out and are holding up, but it may be that were early and the market is still very selective. Time will tell. Need to see potential leaders continue to hold up.

Names with volatile action today: BDC, DCI, FIX, RELL, MTSI, ESE, FCFS, TFII, ESAB, AQUA, PMTS, EME, WIRE, TGLS, WING, ASO, CRUS, MHO, COHU. 

Noticing many liquid names that are in relatively new uptrends and came from nice consolidations that have held up well: FOUR, MELI, HUBS, CSCO. 

Looking back in my journal from late Feb to mid March, many of the names that were setting up and looking great are breaking down. I spotted 5 big movers on 2/26 and all, with the exception of TMDX, made big moves and subsequently broke down from ATH or 52-week highs. Same thing happening over and over. Need another list of breakdowns to confirm? Check the lists mentioned on 2/27 too. They set up and get sold into at new highs.

Stock Feedback Model turned to orange today. Added 2 new positions: WING, MBLY and added to an existing position: RETA. WING was a pullback buy in the handle of a large base. MBLY isn't fully developed and position was small at 2%, a starter. Would like to see this develop and tighten a bit more. Will be adding if that happens. RETA wasn't a bad add but it was slightly above the ideal spot. I learned a lesson on this one as it was brought up in the QA session: I incorrectly added at the high of the left-side of the base (52-week high) around 95. I should have added around 93.50 (highest) as it was the high of the pivot (~2% lower). Currently up on: SNPS, ASO, WING. Down slightly on MBLY, RETA but neither stock is doing anything wrong. Looking to add exposure if warranted, have ~$30 more risk until at 1% total equity.

Overall stock action has been encouraging and improving. ISEE and APLS both gapped up huge today from excellent buy points. Stocks that have recently broke out from good buy points are holding up: RMBS, FIVE, BDC, CSCO, MSI, AXON, PANW, MHO, AXON, HROW, MNST, TRI, EXTR, ANET, THMC. VIX below 19.

"The U.S. banking system is strong and resilient." J. Powell eased any concerns of a worsening banking crisis. He believes it is mostly contained and due to (SVB) being among a riskier bank without enough federal oversight. Market volatile all afternoon. IWM, SPY, QQQ, DJI, all closed lower on huge bullish engulfings. Just terrible action.

Got stopped on ISEE. Tested the waters lightly and found out very quickly what I need to know - STAY OUT. Individual names were volatile today. Many bearish engulfings in individual names too. Very few names even look appetizing and based on stock feedback they're not worth entertaining. Sit out power and cash reign.

Position in ISEE staying tight. Not doing anything wrong but I'd be surprised if the volatility over the next few days doesn't stop me out. FOMC meeting tomorrow and anticipating volatility. COHU, GRBK, nice setups that squatted today. STN full-on pivot failure today. Volatile down day from nice tight (but short) pivot. 

Not many names setup. Few names in buyable position: RETA, COHU, TSCO, and TH. Few names that could be setup soon: FTNT, GRBK, SGML, BJ, HROW, MHO, MCHP, PMTS, MSI, MSCI. Some older names like HLIT, MAXN, SMCI made nice moves today. Primary list building up a little as week progresses. Will see how things unfold remainder of week.

Bought a micro-position in ISEE today as sort of a 'mental health buy' as David Ryan would put it. Will do the same with COHU if it acts right. SGML took off today from a decent pivot - went inside one day and blasted off ~11%. Not many names out there and the best moves have been in precious metals. Risking $6 on ISEE just to keep my eye on the ball and see how this name behaves. Coming from a pretty good VCP setup. Also, whether I get on it or not, if COHU can't work, I shouldn't entertain the market. It's in the same group as AEHR, ACLS, CVV. Best names out there and it's coming from a textbook VCP. 

Low-volume on the general market today. QQQ's look the best. SPY as well as many stocks, have 'bear flags' or 'bearish pennants' on their right sides. Will the SPY break to the downside? The daily range of the VIX has been huge. 

Stock feedback red and guiding decisions to be micro.

After doing some PTA (which will henceforth be logged [here](PTA.html)), noticing that many of my buys were spot-on but they were near 52-week highs. My buys sometimes marked the top or were at a breakout level that subsequently moved sideways in a volatile manner. Markets simply aren't bidding up most stocks into ATH or 52-week high territory; and if they do it doesn't last long. Few stocks have stood out and look obvious in hindsight, but with no real trend and the majority of setups not working, it's been very tough to make money all year. Made perfect buys on XLE, QSR, VC, VTYX, AXON, RXDX, IBB, BIIB, PRDO, and OIH. That's 10 of 16 buys that were excellent in hindsight. I've come a long way in my selection and timing. Money and portfolio management also making serious improvements. Down 2.31% on the year. Right there with both Mark's. Feeling no FOMO. 

I did a great job managing my winning trades, despite only really having two. Held them for an average of 26 days! As of this writing, my numbers are: avg gain - 14.49%, avg loss - 3.54%, BA - 12.5%, W/L - 4.09, aW/L - 0.51. Results are telling me to be very selective and conservative. A few problems during this last rally: (1) reaction time to poor results in the market. (2) Over reacting to breath thrust indicator (3) Slight FOMO near the end of the rally. 

A few stops were hit early on in names like SLGN, QSR, and RXDX. At that same time, I had 4 solid names with open profits: XLE, VC, VTYX, AXON. I leaned on these open profits and took on more risk. Next time, coming from 100% cash and a bear market, <b>I shouldn't lean so heavily on open profits coming from a correction unless the gains are locked in with a backstop.</b> In XLE, VC, AXON, I had no more than 7% gains (which I leaned on) and this later came back to bite me. XLE and AXON both stopped me out. After getting stopped out on SLGN, QSR, RXDX, XLE, and AXON with only VC and VTYX working, I should have held off on buying and let the names I had play out. Instead I kept on buying without making any real traction. On balance I was around break-even and I noticed more names setting up. For this reason, it's ok to continue buying, but I should have had more alarm bells going off and should have been SUPER selective and small. Buying should be very small and only the best of the bread. I think I was blinded by a couple of names that had double-digit profits, the breadth thrust, the general market, and optimism from both Mark's.. It ended up being that every name thereafter stopped me out and I lost money on every trade. FOLD and XENE were full-on FOMO trades.

Overall, I'm happy with my trading, but a few too many names due to a slow reaction to stock feedback and slight FOMO took me down $200 or so more than I believe I should have lost. My solution is the advent of the daily journal entries and stock feedback model. I believe this will keep me more in-tune and force me to take a more honest and thorough review of my portfolio and the markets each day.

First Republic Bank announced they were struggling this morning. The list now includes: SVB, Silvergate Capital, Signature Bank, Credit Suisse, and First Republic. The explanation according to Mark, "The FED has been aggressively tightening rates and this has caused many depositors to wake up and realize that they can earn far more yield in treasuries than leaving them deposited at their local bank, thus causing a run on deposits. The FED has since created its BTFD program to help stem any liquidity issues banks may be having, but the headlines continue to be unsettling."

Support has been coming in on the indexes but it's from an oversold condition (QQQ's weren't oversold and look best). Not much out there that looks appetizing. We saw a decent setup and move in TSCO this morning. ANET, CDNS, and TXRH all made nice moves (to new high's) from decent bases today. Expecting near-term volatility.

Noticing big declines in groups that were previously outperforming: machinery, manufacturing, and industrial services. Updated weekly charts to watch on index page.

Stocks that I traffic look sloppy and volatile. Hardly anything to entertain. Biggest movers today came from junk off the lows. 

Seeing some supportive volume on the SPY and QQQ the last 2-3 days. IWM not looking as good. Crude oil prices broke a 6-month channel to the downside and dropped to its lowest level since January 2022. Seeing some technology stocks getting bids. However, some blowups as well. LUNA is an example. Contrarily, names like BJ and TSCO looking good and clearly getting bids. I think this points to the uncertainty of the market right now. No real trends, lots of rotation. Sidelined and 100% cash.

CPI release this morning and the market opened on a gap. Volatility is the word of the week for the stock market and I am practicing extreme caution in these uncertain times. Here's a note from Mark this morning which provides more color: 

Mark:

In panic fashion, the 2-year yield fell 100bps in just the last three trading sessions, the fastest drop in over 35 years since the Black Monday Crash of 1987. As a result - like Nomura - some have drastically changed their economic and Fed forecasts.

While it’s premature to predict whether the recent banking crisis will trump CPI and PPI data coming out this week and influence the Fed, the expectation for a rate hike has indeed shifted slightly on the side of a pause. One thing is pretty certain, economic data due out over the next two days will likely fuel more volatility. 

Follow [this link](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), which estimates the probabilities of Fed Funds Rate. 

In an effort to contain the spread of contagion from the SVB collapse, the Fed launched a new lending program late Sunday. The creation of the Fed’s new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) is designed to halt bank runs of stressed financial institutions. Eligible depositories can now borrow for up to one year pledging Treasurys and agency MBS, which will be valued at par. That plugs a $620 billion hole created by the unrealized losses on securities holdings.

The structure is similar to those rolled out during the pandemic and during the GFC. The Treasury will provide $25 billion in capital from the Exchange Stabilization fund as a backup. As has been done previously, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be covered by a special assessment on banks, not taxpayers. Additionally, the government will fully protect both insured and uninsured depositors of SVB and of Signature Bank, which was closed on Sunday. Reminiscent of the Bear Stearns rescue by J.P. Morgan in March 2008, this should help limit the collateral damage to the economy and allow companies to meet payroll and other obligations.

The big question is, does the collapse in the 1-year and 2-year yields indicate the tightening cycle is over as I have long been predicting is the "canary in the coal mine." I doubt it. And if so, for the wrong reasons.

Have taken some time away from the markets. Sold the last of VC on 2/28 just before trip with the boys and it turned out to be a great time to be away. The market saw major volatility during the past two weeks and individual stocks have been breaking down. Many pivot failures and a considerable amount of base failures. Looking back on my recent trades, stop losses have saved me from a lot of turmoil. Everything is lower than my sell points with the exception of: AXON, RXDX, and FRHC. <b>That means 13 of 16 stocks broke down after setting up.</b> This tells the whole story.

Some interesting and mostly negative developments include: Major distribution in the major averages. IWM, SPY, QQQ, and FFTY all got hit hard and the prospect of the indexes going lower doesn't seem far fetched. VIX spiked up again. SVB collapse and many banking stocks getting hit hard. Is this the start of something more serious? XLF has gotten clobbered; along with many other industries including XLE, XBI, XLE, XLB, and XME. FFTY barely above its lows. Interestingly, the yields have all taken big hits over the past 2-days. The 1-year got wrecked today. Would love to see this break down long-term. TAN coiling on the weekly. Will it break to the upside? <b>FSLR, MAXN, ARRY</b> all look pretty good. Metals, steels, precious metals,

Sitting on the sidelines for the time being. Not interested in being the first to this party. Feels like we have a ways to go with this bear market. Staying engaged and ready.

Focus list: AEHR, FSLR, ARRY, PODD, EPAC, AAON, CECO, BOWL, ACLS, HROW, ESP, TMUS, MSI, MNST, TH, TRI, AQUA, LMB, MCHP, ADI, STM, WING, COCO. List added to index page today.

Week of 2/26 - 3/4
</summary>
<span style="color:#FFFF99">*2/27/2023*</span>
<div class="box1">
<font color="black">

A lot of reversals today with a small list of names setting up/breaking out. Also noticing a lot of bearish looking flags on the right sides of bases. Notable reversals on focus list include: CECO, TMUS, AXON, UPFT, GPC, VTYX, OCN, AGCO. Worth noting that both the SPY and QQQ's closed low in their range.

Interested to see what happens in these 'bearish flags' like: SANM, HROW, KLAC, TMUS, FLEX, . Are they tightening and consolidating or bracing to move lower? Feels like they'll go lower considering how poorly stocks have been acting. Lots of names breaking down/experiencing volatility: BELFB, BDC, IT, ALNY, TH, RELL, GILD, BIIB, ARRY, APH, PODD, IMCR. It's hard to get excited in this market. Rotation is fierce and breakouts to new highs simply aren't working. The bids dry up. Sometimes within minutes. Watching AEHR, MTZ, OCN, EPAC, ATRO, AGCO, and BOWL closely for anything promising. Earnings coming up in quite a few names.

Personal STEM model created and set to red today. This is influenced by the recent change to red (on 2/23/2023) on the MPA platform but is, and will continue to be, based on my personal 'feel' of the market. My feel for the market is based primarily on feedback and amount of pressure from recent trades. Thus far, 2023 has been very similar to 2022 in that breakouts are not working. Volatility is too high for low-risk entries. Discipline and sit-out power will reign.

Big moves: FIX, TMDX, EME, ATKR, ALG

<u>2023 Reflection:</u>
My portfolio saw some volatility early on in SLGN and QSR. These were the first warning signs that I didn't take seriously enough. At that time, my largest position was XLE which began working immediately and looked promising. With 1 of 3 names working and more names setting up, I decided to buy VC on 1/17 which went down-to-sideways for a few days post-buy. That same day and on 1/18, I got stopped on both QSR and SLGN. I let XLE and VC work and by 1/23 I was up on both positions and green on balance; with that, I decided to buy VTYX and AXON on 1/23. Both worked immediately. 

I then added RXDX, IBB, and BIIB over the 26th and 27th. I got stopped on RXDX same day and sold a portion of VTYX for 2R on the 27th. Things were looking up for the most part. By 1/30 BIIB closed below 50-day and I sold half. IBB put me under pressure immediately but acted normal. On balance things were good until the end of the first week in February when I got stopped on ADEA, PRDO, and AXON. PRDO was the first real shot across the bow. Beautiful breakout that came all the way back.. all too familiar. Note: I tried buying more PRDO when it came in early morning post-b/o and it hit me harder when it underwent a pivot failure. This hasn't worked and shouldn't be done again. AXON was acting perfectly (though subject to pullback) until it broke over 14% in one day and stopped me out. This should have been a glaringly obvious sign to stop buying and go into protective mode. However, I kept buying and added FOLD and FRHC. A week later I added OIH, APH, and XENE. OIH was the only acceptable buy of those final 5. Otherwise, FOLD, FRHC, APH, and XENE were all <u>BAD BUYS</u> and can be attributed to FOMO. I need to be quicker to adjust and interpret the feedback the market is giving me.

In hindsight I can see how the 'breadth thrust' and new wave of setups made me overly eager to get into the market. Both Mark's were buying and admit to being down slightly (1-2%) so far this year. I'm right there with them, so I'm not too upset about the performance because I remained conservative and adhered to stops. But this latest run taught me that I'm not reflecting/synthesizing the market feedback enough each day. Hence, the advent of my STEM model and journal.

Down about 2.5%, or ~$360, as of this writing.
